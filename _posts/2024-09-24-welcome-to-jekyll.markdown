This isn't actually my first day at [RC]: https://recurse.com, it's my second. The first day was virtual over Zoom, going through the typical orientations and introductions, like social rules, what to do during your time at Recurse, meeting all the other recursers, etc.

The second day is the first day that Recursers are invited into the physical space, known as The Hub. The Hub is located in Brooklyn, NY. As of this writing, there are 80 recursers currently participating in the Fall 2 batch. 

So what am I doing on my second day at RC?

The first goal I have is to simply relaunch my website. It's been sitting dormant for probably over 5 years now. Me writing this blog post is the birth of the new site. I plan to blog about my projects while at RC. 

What about my second goal at RC?

While I am still figuring out exactly what I want to do during my time at RC, I know I want to branch out and spent most of my time learning and using a new programming language. I've been doing iOS development professionally for nearly 10 years, and during that time I haven't really branched out. It's been purely Swift and Objectice-C, so I am looking forward to picking up something else and just start hacking. For some reason, I lean towards C++ or Rust. C++ has always been interesting to me, but it also has always felt super intimidating. Perhaps Rust is a way to satisfy that curiousity while also being able to lean on the RC community for help (there are a bunch of Rust people here in my batch).

And that's about it. Other than attempting to pick which language or languages I want to pursue, I don't have a 100% clear idea of where that will take me. Distributed systems seem cool, so maybe that will take me somewhere. But not having a clear idea is a perfect oppurtunity to explore, hack, and see where it takes me.
